.SH NAME
fence_virtd - Fencing host for virtual machines

.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
fence_virtd is a host daemon designed to route fencing requests for
virtual machines.

Fence_virt and fence_xvm talk to fence_virtd, which supports multiple backend plugins, including:
 - libvirt for single-node operation
 - Cluster Checkpoints when using Linux-cluster release 3.0.0 or later
 - libvirt-qpid for multi-node, non-cluster operation

For compatibility, fence_xvm from linux-cluster release 2 may talk to fence_virtd.

.P
fence_virtd accepts a few options on the command line, but most options
are read from fence_virtd.conf.
