.SH NAME
fence_zvm - Power Fencing agent for GFS on System z z/VM Clusters

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
fence_zvm
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
fence_zvm is a Power Fencing agent used on a GFS virtual machine in a System z z/VM cluster.
It uses the SMAPI interface to recycle an active image.

fence_zvm accepts options on the command line as well as from stdin.
fence_node sends the options through stdin when it execs the agent.
fence_zvm can be run by itself with command line options which is useful
for testing.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-o --action\fP
Fencing action: "off" - deactivate virtual machine; "on" - activate virtual machine; "metadata" - display device metadata" - describe fence agent parameters; "status" - state of virtual machine
.TP
\fB--delay\fP \fIseconds\fP
Time to delay fencing action in seconds
.TP
\fB-n --plug\fP \fItarget\fP
Name of virtual machine to recycle.
.TP
\fB-h --help\fP
Print out a help message describing available options, then exit.
.TP
\fB-a --ip\fP \fIsmapi Server\fP
\fBName\fP of SMAPI server virtual machine. To be consistent with other fence agents this name is a little misleading: it is the name of the virtual machine not its IP address or hostname.
.TP
\fB--zvmsys\fP \fIz/VM System\fP
\fBName\fP of z/VM on which the SMAPI server virtual machine resides. Optional - defaults to system on which the node is running.
.TP
\fB-h --help\fP
Display usage information
.TP
\fI-t --timeout = < shutdown timeout >\fP
Amount of \fIgrace\fP time to give the virtual machine to shutdown cleanly before being
forcibly terminated. Currently, this option is ignored.

.SH STDIN PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIagent = < param >\fP
This option is used by fence_node(8) and is ignored by fence_zvm.
.TP
\fIaction = < action >\fP
Fencing action: "off" - fence off device; "metadata" - display device metadata; "status" - state of device
.TP
\fIport = < target >\fP
Name of virtual machine to recycle.
.TP
\fIipaddr= < server name >\fP
\fBName\fP of SMAPI server virtual machine. To be consistent with other fence agents thisname is a little misleading: it is the name of the virtual machine not its IP address or hostname.
.TP
\fItimeout = < shutdown timeout >\fP
Amount of \fIgrace\fP time to give the virtual machine to shutdown cleanly before being
forcibly terminated. Currently, this option is ignored.

.SH NOTES
To use this agent the z/VM SMAPI service needs to be configured to allow the virtual
machine running this agent to connect to it and issue the image_recycle operation.
This involves updating the VSMWORK1 AUTHLIST VMSYS:VSMWORK1. file. The entry should look
something similar to this:

.nf
Column 1                   Column 66                Column 131
|                          |                        |
V                          V                        V
XXXXXXXX                   ALL                      IMAGE_CHARACTERISTICS
.fi

Where XXXXXXX is the name of the virtual machine used in the authuser field of the request. This virtual machine also has to be authorized
to access the system's directory manager.

In addition, the VM directory entry that defines this virtual machine requires the
IUCV ANY statement (or IUCV <userid of SMAPI Server>). This authorizes use of IUCV
to connect to the SMAPI server.
