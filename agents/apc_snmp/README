This is an snmp based fence agent for APC power switches to be used
with RHEL4 Red Hat Cluster Suite.

The reasons to use this agent rather than the current fence_apc agent are:
1) This script has been tested with EVERY powerswitch that APC currently
makes.
2) It will work on many older models that are no longer supported by APC.
I have been told that it even works with the AP9200 switch. Older switches
usually don't do well with the fence_apc script.
3) This agent works with large power switches that have more than 8 outlets.
The fence_apc script will also, in the next update -- this script will work for you now.

If feedback on this beta version of the agent is good, and if ganged switches 
can be supported, then this agent may replace fence_apc.

In order to use this agent, you will need to have net-snmp-utils installed 
on every node in your cluster. net-snmp-utils is scheduled for inclusion 
in the base RHEL distribution for Update 4, and is yummable in FC5.

After net-snmp-utils is installed, there will be a directory named:
/usr/share/snmp/mibs/

Place the accompanying powernet369.mib file in this directory.

To use the agent, cp the agent to the /sbin directory on every
cluster node. The interface for the fence_apc_snmp agent is identical to
the existing fence_apc agent, so if you are using APC for fencing in 
your cluster, you *could* backup your current fence_apc agent, and 
rename this agent from fence_apc_snmp to fence_apc, and it should just work.

NOTE: The fence_apc_snmp agent does not yet support ganged or 'daisy-chained'
APC switches. 

If you would rather not copy over your fence_apc agent, you can still use 
the fence_apc_snmp agent by dropping it into /sbin on every node, and then
defining a <fencedevice> in the cluster.conf file with agent="fence_apc_snmp"
as an attribute, and use it that way. Note, please, that the GUI does
not support this agent yet, and you will have to edit your cluster.conf 
by hand and then propagate it yourself. If you need help with this, email
me on linux-cluster or at the address below.

Big thanks to Nate Straz who laid the foundation for this agent.

Please let me know how this agent works.
