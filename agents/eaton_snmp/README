This is an snmp based fence agent for Eaton power distribution units to be used
with RHEL4 Red Hat Cluster Suite.

In order to use this agent, you will need to have net-snmp-utils installed 
on every node in your cluster. net-snmp-utils is scheduled for inclusion 
in the base RHEL distribution for Update 4, and is yummable in FC5.

To use the agent, cp the agent to the /sbin directory on every
cluster node.

Then define a <fencedevice> in the cluster.conf file with
agent="fence_eaton_snmp" as an attribute, and use it that way.
Note, please, that the GUI does not support this agent yet, and you will have
to edit your cluster.conf by hand and then propagate it yourself. If you need
help with this, email me at the address below.

The interface for the fence_eaton_snmp agent is identical to the existing
fence_apc_snmp agent, upon which it has been derived.
